This is notes from when I took over this repo after Swathi.
There are 2 models v3 and v4. v3 code has been integrated.
V4 has not been integrated into code yet. 
Main difference is V4 has seprate models for invoice, discount and promotion.
What would be better is, take invoice model from V1 or V2 and use discount and promotion model from V4.
(IIRC V1 or V2 invoice model is better than V3 (but please check))

real_world_examples.csv contains examples where model did not perform well.

svmOnlySI.py is training code used for V2 of model. It is just 
svm.py with sligtly modified dataset and no Discount and promotion.

svmDIPS.py is just svm.py with different dataset (which was manually labeled)

svmSeparate.py is trains all models seprately. It has seprate invoice model, seprate discount model
and seprate promotion model. Use only discount and promo model, as this invoice model has lower accuracy than existing model.

rules.py contains an iteration of DIPS (Discount Invoice Promotion Spam) model which uses rules to further classify (idt its used)

harsh-requirements.txt is requirements that worked for my use case
